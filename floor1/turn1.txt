You gloop into slimy existence in a small room, old dust swirling across the floor as you stand. Where your pseudopods touch the floor you can taste rot on the stone.

Open pathways are south, east and west. A locked door is north.

There's half a key on the ground in front of you. You can only tell it's a key from the outline of the other half, rotted away.

There's also a vibrant red potion in the corner.

You may Fuse any two items you have of the same Tier to produce a new item, [B]deterministically[/B] (same combo of items = same result).
The items must be of equal or lesser Tier to your Fusion ability, currently [B]Tier 1.[/B]
Successfully fusing two items will also grant you [B]Aether [/B](and Max Aether if needed), a resource you can expend once you learn other skills.
Your Fuse tier will increment whenever you pass from one floor/level to the next.

[B]Decomposite[/B] (3 Q) (class skill): Separate a semi-autonomous blob of yourself. It will follow commands and can start with an order to carry out.
You'll gain class skills when your Fusion tier increases, and can, rarely, learn non-class skills from other sources.
