You are [B]this enterprising fellow.[/B] You aim to delve the [B]Fivefold Dungeon[/B] and swipe the secrets and loot within. You are an alchemical adept, and as such can [B]Fuse[/B] scraps you find to make... well, for now, [B]better scraps[/B]. You'll have to work on that.

But questions remain.

What is your [B]name?[/B]
What is your [B]class? [an adjective] + [a noun][/B]

[SPOILER="What is this?"]
This is an image quest. All y'all suggest actions for our adept to take, and the actions with the highest votes will be carried out.
I'll resolve the actions and post the result.
Most actions will be resolved by D20, though some have special mechanics which will be clarified when introduced.
There will only be five levels, and each level will have five rooms. Scope creep is my archnemesis with these things...[/SPOILER]

[SPOILER="Status"]
Name: [I]none[/I]
Class: [I]none[/I]
HP: 10/10
Q (Aether): 5/10
Inventory: 0/10 slots full
[/SPOILER]
[SPOILER="Fusion <1>"]
You may Fuse any two items you have of the same Tier to produce a new item, [B]deterministically[/B] (same combo of items = same result).
The items must be of equal or lesser Tier to your Fusion ability, currently [B]Tier 1.[/B]
Successfully fusing two items will also grant you [B]Aether [/B](and Max Aether if needed), a resource you can expend once you learn other skills.
Your Fuse tier will increment whenever you pass from one floor/level to the next.
[/SPOILER]
[SPOILER="Known Fusions"]
You haven't observed any combinations yet!
[/SPOILER]
[SPOILER="Skills/Spells"]
Skills and spells cost [B]Q[/B] (the abbreviation for [B]Aether[/B]) to use.
You don't have any of them yet!
You'll gain class skills when your Fusion tier increases, and can, rarely, learn non-class skills from other sources.
